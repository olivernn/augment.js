# Augment.js

Augment.js is a library that brings JavaScript 1.8.5 to any browser.  It does this by augmenting built in types like `Array` and `Object`.

It combines the code snippets supplied by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) for implementing methods using the exact algorithms specified in ECMA specifications.

Thanks to Mozilla for doing most of the hard work by sharing pure JavaScript implementations for these methods on their website.
