# Augment.js

Augment.js is a library that brings JavaScript 1.8.5 to any browser.  It does this by augmenting built in types like `Array` and `Object`.

It combines the code snippets supplied by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) for implementing methods using the exact algorithms specified in ECMA specifications.

## Docs

For documentation and usage see the [Augment.js](http://olivernn.github.com/augment.js) docs site.

## Build

You can create a custom build of Augment.js by using the builder script.  For more details run `./builder -h` from within the project directory.

## Contributing

Run the tests suite with `make test` then open localhost:8003 in your browser. Hack, tests and open a pull request.

## Credits

Thanks to Mozilla for doing most of the hard work by sharing pure JavaScript implementations for these methods on their website.
